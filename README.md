Required Reading
================

There's a convention in academia – of which I'm proudly a part - that reading lists are broken down into two categories: **Required Reading** and **Recommended Reading**.

Of course, I'd prefer my students to read **everything** I recommend, but sadly in these attention span atrophied times, where it seems even 140 characters is too much of a strain, the distinction between 'Required' and 'Recommended' proves useful.

Required Reading is… well… required. Inescapable. We all, I hope, have ambition to grow creatively as individuals, and to do so, a little hard work is required. Put in the work, however, and the rewards – I guarantee you – will be immeasurable. All that new knowledge pays off.

ROI.

If you're a creative (and, really, who isn't?) I hope you'll find some value in this list. The following books, though loosely categorised, focus on core principles that will, I believe, serve any self-respecting creative well, forming the backbone of a comprehensive library.

As [a regular conference speaker](http://tinybooks.org/speaking/), I've organised the books in two ways: firstly, by books that informed recent presentations I've given at conferences; secondly, by books that I've loosely categorised under a variety of headings.
