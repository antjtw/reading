Required Reading
================

There’s a convention in academia – of which I’m proudly a part – that reading lists are broken down into two categories: **Required Reading** and **Recommended Reading**.

Of course, I’d prefer my students to read everything I recommend, but sadly in these attention span atrophied times – where it seems even 140 characters is too much of a strain – the distinction between ‘Required’ and ‘Recommended’ proves useful.

Required Reading is, well, required. Inescapable.

We all, I hope, have ambition to grow creatively as individuals, and to do so, a little hard work is required. Put in the work, however, and the rewards, I guarantee you, will be immeasurable. All that new knowledge pays off.

If you’re a creative (and, really, who isn’t?) I hope you’ll find some value in this list. The following books, though loosely categorised, focus on core principles that will, I believe, serve any self-respecting creative well, forming the backbone of a comprehensive library.

As [a regular conference speaker](http://tinybooks.org/speaking/), I’ve organised the books in two ways: firstly, by books that informed recent presentations I’ve given at conferences; secondly, by books that I’ve loosely categorised under a variety of headings.

Books Recommended in Recent Talks
---------------------------------

Whenever I present at a conference, I try to inform my thinking by weaving together some reading done beforehand. I recommend three books for every talk, which have underpinned my thinking.

I recommended the following books at each of the events below. There’s occasional overlap, but I hope you find the following useful. All books link to Amazon UK and – in the interests of full disclosure – are affiliate links. If you buy the books, you can help support my work, which I very much appreciate.
