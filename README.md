Required Reading
================

There’s a convention in academia that reading lists are broken down into two categories: **Required Reading** and **Recommended Reading**.

Of course, I’d prefer my students to read everything I recommend, but sadly in these attention span atrophied times – where it seems that even 140 characters is too much of a strain – the distinction between ‘Required’ and ‘Recommended’ proves useful.

Required Reading is, well, required. Inescapable.

We all, I hope, have ambition to grow creatively as individuals, and to do so, a little hard work is required. Put in the work, however, and your return on investment, I guarantee you, will be immeasurable. All that new knowledge pays off.

If you’re a creative (and, really, who isn’t?) I hope you’ll find some value in this list. The following books, though loosely categorised, focus on core principles that will, I believe, serve any self-respecting creative well, forming the backbone of a comprehensive library.

As [a regular conference speaker](http://tinybooks.org/speaking/), I’ve organised the books in two ways: firstly, by books that informed recent presentations I’ve given at conferences; secondly, by books that I’ve loosely categorised under a variety of headings.

Books Recommended in Recent Talks
---------------------------------

Whenever I speak at a conference, I endeavour to inform my thinking by weaving together some reading that I undertake beforehand. I recommend three books for every talk, which have underpinned my thinking.

I recommended the following books at each of the events below. There’s occasional overlap, but I hope you find the list useful.

All books link to Amazon UK and – in the interests of full disclosure – are affiliate links. If you buy the books, you can help support my work, which I very much appreciate.

Books you owe it to yourself to own (and read).
-----------------------------------------------

The following books merit reading and will, I believe, help to improve your thinking.

In each category I’ve ordered the books according to my personal preference, reflecting their usefulness to me. It’s always a challenge to introduce an order when you believe every book has value. It goes without saying that, if money were no object, I’d honestly recommend buying them all (or at least a couple from each list).
